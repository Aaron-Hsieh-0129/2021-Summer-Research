# 2021-Summer-Research——Vector Vorticity Model (VVM) and Quasi Compressible Model (QCM)
Two-dimensional VVM and QCM

## Warm ceal with unstable environment and without initial wind velocity

Shading: potential temperature perturbation (a physical variable which is similar to temperature)

contour: qc (cloud water), blue dots: qr (rain water > thershold)

Shading: potential temperature perturbation (a physical variable likes temperature), contour: qc (cloud water), blue dots: qr (rain water > thershold)

## UML diagram: show the structure of VVM (QCM is similar).
